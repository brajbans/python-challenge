The first analysis  is to calculate (budget data analysis)
- the total number of months included in the data set
- the net total amount of "Profit/Losses over the entire period
- the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

First steps is to import dependancies and create a path to read csv file

Set the data to collect and create the lists to use

Store the lists - total_profits as a number

for total of the months use the len function to calculate the number of rows in the column

create a monlthly_change list by getting difference of each month
calculate average using the monthly_change
use the min and max function to get the monthly_change 

use print function to print out the data

The second analysis  is to calculate (election_data analysis)
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

First steps is to import dependancies and create a path to read csv file

Set the data to collect and create the lists to use

Create a for loop to calculate total votes & search for candidate names 

calculate percentage of the votes per candidate

print the results
